# Project-1 Proposal

Our project is to determine if it is more lucrative to live in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area or Greater Minnesota based on the ratio of wages to cost of living. We'll examine trends in housing and wage data over time in the Twin Cities and Greater Minnesota; median income and average expenses for each area; and related questions, as the data admits.

Questions:
- What is the difference between median income and median household income?
- What percentage of average expenses are housing depending on location, and how does this compare to the defintion of cost of living?
- How does the changes in wages over time compare to the changes in housing/rental prices, and is there a significant difference between rentals and average mortgages?
- Does our data for Minnesota hold true for other states?
